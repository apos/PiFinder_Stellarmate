Two possibilities this md was called from the chat: this is a running or a new chat session:

    "read ctx.md and load": If this is a new sesssion, Read session.md to reflect the actual status and also the next steps. Read necessary files to understand the context.

    "read ctx.md and save" If this is a running session, update the local session.md to reflect the actual status and also the next steps in a way, that I can safely restart the session in case of a session breakdown. Therefore you need to remember:

    which files have been created or altered and why (for each)
    which files to re-read for having the context (setup, pathing, funcitons.sh)
    know the most important key concepts and strategies you implemented
    necessary next steps.
    also write down all necessary requirements to continue or repeat the actual state (installed packages, necessary dependencies, strategies... )

If you have some strategies, also write down or update a correspondent "session_advanced.md" with even more critical informations and strategies you'll probably need in future session.

After you wrote the file, save memory in your gemini md environment for a quick startup - continue with your actual plans!
